# Neural Magic SparseML and DeepSparse Flows for Akamai Cloud Platforms

This README provides an overview of the available tutorials and guides for optimizing and deploying models using Neural Magic's tools.

## Tutorials

### 1. YOLOv8 Object Detection: Sparse Transfer Learning

Learn how to fine-tune a pre-sparsified YOLOv8 model using SparseML's CLI, export it to ONNX, and deploy it with DeepSparse for efficient object detection inference.

[Read the tutorial](docs_object_detection_python_yolov8_sparse_transfer.md)

### 2. Sentiment Analysis: Sparse Transfer Learning with the Python API

Discover how to fine-tune a 90% pruned BERT model on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset using SparseML's Hugging Face Integration, apply model distillation, export to ONNX, and deploy with DeepSparse.

### 3. Optimizing LLMs with One-Shot Pruning and Quantization

Explore techniques for optimizing large language models (LLMs) using sparsification and quantization. Learn how to apply one-shot compression to the TinyLlama chat model, evaluate its performance, export to ONNX, and deploy with DeepSparse.
