# Exporting Hugging Face Models Using Optimum and Running Them in DeepSparse

This guide harnesses the power of Neural Magic's DeepSparse Inference Runtime library in combination with Hugging Face's ONNX models. DeepSparse offers a cutting-edge solution for efficient and accelerated inference on deep learning models, optimizing performance and resource utilization. By seamlessly integrating DeepSparse with Hugging Face's ONNX models, users can experience lightning-fast inference times while maintaining the flexibility and versatility of the widely adopted ONNX format alongside the Optimum library for PyTorch model ONNX exporting.

This notebook will use several popular models found on the Hugging Face Hub for text classification, zero-shot classification, question answering, NER and image classification.
